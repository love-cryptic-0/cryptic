    Love

      <h1>she sits. she watches. you draw close. she turns away. you call her name. she doesn't respond. you draw nearer. she turns to
you. she says she loves you. you love her. she says she's sorry. you feel a cold pressure. you feel the blood seep into your clothes. she once more says she's sorry. she says she loves you. you say you love her. you forgive her. the pain of the blade increases with every second. you kiss her. you wake up. she not beside you.</h1>
